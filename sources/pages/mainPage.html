                Black & White is a site that is designed mostly with HTML and CSS with added functionality using JavaScript. The site is to display and launch games to show the capabilites of Javascript within a webpage. The site is dedicated for a quick introduction to web design.

                At the top of the page there are links to the Main Page (where you currently are) and other links to description of the games and references.
